# Knowledgefall Mobile Game

## Description

Welcome to the **Knowledgefall** mobile game, an exciting and educational gaming experience developed in the Godot 4.1 engine. In this game, you'll need to test your reflexes and knowledge as you face falling tiles of various colors. Your goal is to match the color of the tile with the color you select at the bottom of the screen, and then tap the corresponding tile. But beware, as the tiles fall faster as the game progresses!

Additionally, you'll encounter special tiles marked with a question mark. Destroying these tiles presents an opportunity to test your knowledge in history or geography. Answer correctly to continue your game, or else, you'll lose. 

**Knowledgefall** offers different difficulty levels to suit your preference, allowing you to adjust both the number of available colors and the level of difficulty for the questions. 

- **Easy Mode**: Choose from 3 different colors.
- **Medium Mode**: Test your skills with 6 colors.
- **Hard Mode**: Take on the ultimate challenge with 9 colors.
- **Special Mode**: Play with 3 colors and match shapes as well!

Are you up for the challenge? Let's see how well you can match colors and answer questions as the tiles rain down!
